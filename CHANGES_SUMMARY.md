# Changes Summary - Nested OU Support Fix

## Date
October 25, 2025

## Problem
The LDAP OU Filter app was not working correctly because:
1. All users appeared to be in the same OU (`Mail`)
2. The app was extracting only the top-level OU, not the specific sub-OU
3. With nested OUs like `Mail/cyberfirst`, `Mail/first`, `Mail/elzoz`, `Mail/bebo`, everyone appeared in "Mail"

## Files Changed

### 1. ‚úÖ `lib/Service/LdapOuService.php`
**What Changed:**
- Updated `extractOuFromDn()` method to handle nested OUs
- Now filters out the "Mail" parent OU automatically
- Extracts the most specific sub-OU (cyberfirst, first, elzoz, bebo)
- Added comprehensive debug logging

**Key Logic:**
```php
// OLD: Just took the first OU (which was "Mail")
$selectedOu = $ouParts[0];

// NEW: Filters out "Mail" and gets the specific OU
$specificOus = array_filter($ouParts, function($ou) {
    $ouValue = strtolower(trim(substr($ou, 3)));
    return $ouValue !== 'mail';
});
$selectedOu = reset($specificOus); // Gets cyberfirst, first, etc.
```

**Debug Output:**
- Shows full DN
- Lists all OU levels found
- Shows which OU was selected
- Logs: `=== OU EXTRACTION DEBUG ===`

### 2. ‚úÖ `lib/AppInfo/Application.php`
**What Changed:**
- Added dual event listener registration
- Bootstrap registration + Direct EventDispatcher registration
- Enhanced logging to track event firing
- High priority (100) for early execution

**Why:**
- Ensures event listener is registered even if Bootstrap method has issues
- Logs when SearchResultEvent is detected
- Helps debug why events might not be firing

### 3. ‚úÖ `lib/Listener/UserSearchListener.php`
**What Changed:**
- Enhanced logging throughout the filtering process
- Added exception handling with detailed error messages
- Logs user counts before and after filtering
- Better error reporting

**Debug Output:**
- `UserSearchListener::handle called`
- `Original users count: X`
- `Filtered users count: Y`
- `Filtered search results: X -> Y users`

### 4. üÜï `diagnose.sh` (NEW FILE)
**Purpose:**
- Diagnostic script to troubleshoot OU extraction and filtering
- Shows recent OU-related logs
- Checks event listener registration
- Tests user lookup

**Usage:**
```bash
sudo bash diagnose.sh
```

### 5. üÜï `OU_FIX_GUIDE.md` (NEW FILE)
**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive guide for the nested OU fix
- Explains the problem and solution
- Deployment steps
- Testing process
- Troubleshooting tips

### 6. ‚úÖ `update.sh`
**What Changed:**
- Updated post-deployment instructions
- Added reference to new diagnostic script
- Added reference to OU_FIX_GUIDE.md

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
```
User: hunter1
DN: CN=hunter1,OU=cyberfirst,OU=Mail,DC=Frist,DC=loc
Extracted OU: OU=Mail  ‚ùå (too generic)

User: bebo01  
DN: CN=bebo01,OU=bebo,OU=Mail,DC=Frist,DC=loc
Extracted OU: OU=Mail  ‚ùå (too generic)

Result: Both users in "Mail" ‚Üí No filtering works
```

### After (Fixed):
```
User: hunter1
DN: CN=hunter1,OU=cyberfirst,OU=Mail,DC=Frist,DC=loc
Extracted OU: OU=cyberfirst  ‚úÖ (specific)

User: bebo01
DN: CN=bebo01,OU=bebo,OU=Mail,DC=Frist,DC=loc
Extracted OU: OU=bebo  ‚úÖ (specific)

Result: Users in different OUs ‚Üí Filtering works!
```

## Expected Behavior

### When `hunter1` (cyberfirst OU) searches for users:
- ‚úÖ **Shows**: Users from `cyberfirst` OU only
- ‚ùå **Hides**: Users from `bebo`, `first`, `elzoz` OUs

### When `bebo01` (bebo OU) searches for users:
- ‚úÖ **Shows**: Users from `bebo` OU only
- ‚ùå **Hides**: Users from `cyberfirst`, `first`, `elzoz` OUs

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] Update `lib/Service/LdapOuService.php` with new OU extraction logic
- [x] Update `lib/AppInfo/Application.php` with dual event registration
- [x] Update `lib/Listener/UserSearchListener.php` with enhanced logging
- [x] Create `diagnose.sh` diagnostic script
- [x] Create `OU_FIX_GUIDE.md` documentation
- [x] Update `update.sh` with new instructions
- [ ] Deploy to server
- [ ] Run diagnostics
- [ ] Test filtering
- [ ] Verify logs show correct OU extraction

## Quick Deployment

```bash
# Local machine
cd /Users/roaya/Roaya-files/Development/nxtcloud/NC-Domain\ isolation/ldapoufilter
chmod +x diagnose.sh deploy_to_server.sh update.sh
./deploy_to_server.sh

# On server
cd /var/www/nextcloud/apps/ldapoufilter
sudo bash update.sh
sudo bash diagnose.sh
sudo bash check_logs.sh -f
```

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Check OU Extraction:**
   - Search for logs with `OU EXTRACTION DEBUG`
   - Should show specific OUs (cyberfirst, first, etc.)
   - Should NOT show just "Mail" for everyone

2. **Test Filtering:**
   - Log in as `hunter1` (cyberfirst)
   - Try to share a file
   - Search for "bebo"
   - Should see NO results (different OU)

3. **Verify Event Listener:**
   - Look for `SearchResultEvent detected!` in logs
   - Should appear when searching for users
   - Confirms event listener is firing

## Logs to Watch For

### Good Signs ‚úÖ:
```
=== OU EXTRACTION DEBUG ===
Found 2 OU levels: ["OU=cyberfirst","OU=Mail"]
Selected specific OU (filtered out 'Mail'): OU=cyberfirst
=== FINAL SELECTED OU: OU=cyberfirst ===
```

```
SearchResultEvent detected! Calling listener...
UserSearchListener triggered - SearchResultEvent confirmed!
Original users count: 50
Filtered users count: 5
```

### Bad Signs ‚ùå:
```
FINAL SELECTED OU: OU=Mail  (not specific enough)
```

```
Original users count: 50
Filtered users count: 50  (no filtering happened)
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the changes
2. Deploy to your server using the deployment commands
3. Run `diagnose.sh` to check OU extraction
4. Test by logging in and searching for users
5. Check logs to verify filtering is working
6. Report back with results!

## Support

If filtering still doesn't work after deployment:
1. Run `sudo bash diagnose.sh`
2. Share the output
3. Check logs for `OU EXTRACTION DEBUG` messages
4. Verify what OU is being selected for each user
