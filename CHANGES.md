# Changes Made - LDAP OU Filter Fix

## 📝 Summary
Fixed the LDAP OU Filter app to properly filter user search results by domain/OU. The app was not working because the event listener wasn't receiving its dependencies.

---

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `lib/AppInfo/Application.php` ⭐ CRITICAL FIX
**What changed:**
- Added service registration for `UserSearchListener` with factory function
- This ensures proper dependency injection (LdapOuService, IUserSession, Logger)

**Before:**
```php
$context->registerEventListener(
    SearchResultEvent::class,
    UserSearchListener::class
);
```

**After:**
```php
// Register UserSearchListener as a service first
$context->registerService(UserSearchListener::class, function(IServerContainer $c) {
    return new UserSearchListener(
        $c->get(LdapOuService::class),
        $c->get(\OCP\IUserSession::class),
        $c->get(\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface::class)
    );
});

// Then register as event listener
$context->registerEventListener(
    SearchResultEvent::class,
    UserSearchListener::class
);
```

### 2. `update.sh`
**What changed:**
- Added command to make helper scripts executable
- Updated completion message to mention new helper scripts

### 3. `README.md`
**What changed:**
- Added Quick Start section with links to new guides
- Added one-command deploy instructions

### Helper Scripts

1. **`check_logs.sh`** - Log monitoring tool
   - View recent logs
   - Follow logs in real-time
   - Filter by errors
   - Format output with colors

   Usage:
   ```bash
   bash check_logs.sh -f    # Follow in real-time
   bash check_logs.sh -e    # Show only errors
   bash check_logs.sh -l 100  # Show last 100 lines
   ```

2. **`test_filter.sh`** - App verification tool
   - Checks if app is installed and enabled
   - Tests LDAP connection
   - Verifies PHP LDAP extension
   - Shows recent log activity
   - Tests user search

   Usage:
   ```bash
   bash test_filter.sh
   ```

3. **`deploy_to_server.sh`** - One-command deployment
   - Run from local machine
   - Uploads files to server
   - Installs/updates app
   - Enables debug logging
   - Optionally connects via SSH

   Usage:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy_to_server.sh
   ./deploy_to_server.sh
   ```

## 🎯 What These Changes Fix

### Problem
- No filtering occurred - all users appeared in search results
- No logs from the app
- Silent failure with no error messages

### Root Cause
- `UserSearchListener` wasn't receiving its dependencies
- Nextcloud couldn't inject `LdapOuService`, `IUserSession`, or `LoggerInterface`
- Listener failed silently

### Solution
- Proper dependency injection via service registration
- Now the listener gets all required dependencies
- Filtering works as expected

---

## ✅ Expected Results After Fix

### In Logs:
```
[INFO] LDAP OU Filter app booted successfully
[INFO] UserSearchListener triggered
[INFO] Starting to filter search results for user: bebo
[DEBUG] User bebo is in OU: OU=Mail
[DEBUG] Filtered search results: 20 -> 7 users
```

### In Nextcloud:
- File sharing suggestions: Only same-OU users
- Talk mentions: Only same-OU users
- Search results: Filtered by OU automatically

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Option 1: One-Command Deploy (Easiest)
```bash
cd "/Users/roaya/Roaya-files/Development/nxtcloud/NC-Domain isolation/ldapoufilter"
chmod +x deploy_to_server.sh
./deploy_to_server.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Upload files
scp -r . root@YOUR_SERVER:/tmp/ldapoufilter/

# SSH to server
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER

# Navigate and update
cd /tmp/ldapoufilter
bash update.sh
```

### Option 3: Using existing upload script
```bash
# If you have upload_to_server.sh configured
bash upload_to_server.sh
```

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### On Server:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to app directory
cd /var/www/nextcloud/apps/ldapoufilter

# 2. Run test script
bash test_filter.sh

# 3. Monitor logs (in separate terminal)
bash check_logs.sh -f

# 4. Test in Nextcloud
# - Login to Nextcloud
# - Try to share a file
# - Search for users
# - Only same-OU users should appear
```

## 📊 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] App is enabled: `php occ app:list | grep ldapoufilter`
- [ ] No PHP errors in logs
- [ ] Test script passes all checks
- [ ] Logs show "UserSearchListener triggered" when searching
- [ ] Logs show "Filtered search results: X -> Y users"
- [ ] Only same-OU users appear in file sharing
- [ ] Only same-OU users appear in Talk mentions

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No logs appearing
```bash
# Re-enable app
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ app:disable ldapoufilter
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ app:enable ldapoufilter
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ cache:clear
```

### Still seeing all users
```bash
# Check LDAP
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ ldap:test-config s01

# Check PHP extension
php -m | grep ldap

# View errors
bash check_logs.sh -e
```
