## 🎯 Issue Fixed: Nested OU Support

### The Problem
Your Active Directory has nested OUs:
- `Mail/cyberfirst/` (hunter1 is here)
- `Mail/first/`
- `Mail/elzoz/`
- `Mail/bebo/` (bebo users here)

The app was extracting only "Mail" for everyone, so ALL users appeared in the same OU.

### The Solution
✅ Now extracts the **specific sub-OU** (cyberfirst, first, elzoz, bebo)  
✅ Filters out the parent "Mail" OU automatically  
✅ Users can only see others from their specific OU

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix

### When `hunter1` (cyberfirst OU) searches:
- ✅ Sees only users from `cyberfirst`
- ❌ Does NOT see users from `bebo`, `first`, `elzoz`

### When `bebo01` (bebo OU) searches:
- ✅ Sees only users from `bebo`
- ❌ Does NOT see users from `cyberfirst`, `first`, `elzoz`

---

## 🔧 All Available Scripts

```bash
diagnose.sh       # Check OU extraction and app status
check_logs.sh     # View/monitor Nextcloud logs
test_filter.sh    # Test app installation
update.sh         # Deploy updates to server
deploy_to_server.sh  # Upload from local to server (if configured)
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If filtering doesn't work after deployment:

1. **Run diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   sudo bash diagnose.sh
   ```

2. **Check what OU is extracted:**
   Look for `FINAL SELECTED OU` in the output
   - ✅ Good: `OU=cyberfirst`, `OU=first`, `OU=bebo`
   - ❌ Bad: `OU=Mail` (too generic)

3. **Verify event listener:**
   ```bash
   sudo bash check_logs.sh -f
   ```
   Then search for users in Nextcloud
   Look for: `SearchResultEvent detected!`

4. **Share logs:**
   Copy the output from `diagnose.sh` and `check_logs.sh`

## 📝 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Read DEPLOY_NOW.md
- [ ] Make scripts executable (`chmod +x *.sh`)
- [ ] Deploy files to server
- [ ] Run `sudo bash update.sh`
- [ ] Run `sudo bash diagnose.sh`
- [ ] Open logs: `sudo bash check_logs.sh -f`
- [ ] Test in Nextcloud (search for users from different OU)
- [ ] Verify logs show correct OU extraction
- [ ] Verify filtering works (users from other OUs hidden)
