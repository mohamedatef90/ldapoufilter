# 🚀 Deploy NOW - Quick Guide

## The Fix is Ready!

I've fixed the nested OU issue. Here's what you need to do:

## 📋 What Was Fixed

Your Active Directory structure:
```
Mail/
  ├── cyberfirst/ ← hunter1 is here
  ├── first/
  ├── elzoz/
  └── bebo/ ← bebo users are here
```

**Problem:** App was extracting "Mail" for everyone (too generic)  
**Solution:** Now extracts specific sub-OU (cyberfirst, first, elzoz, bebo)

## 🎯 Files Updated

1. ✅ `lib/Service/LdapOuService.php` - Smart OU extraction
2. ✅ `lib/AppInfo/Application.php` - Enhanced event registration
3. ✅ `lib/Listener/UserSearchListener.php` - Better logging
4. 🆕 `diagnose.sh` - New diagnostic tool
5. 🆕 `OU_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide
6. 🆕 `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - All changes documented

## ⚡ Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: On Your Mac (Local)
```bash
cd "/Users/roaya/Roaya-files/Development/nxtcloud/NC-Domain isolation/ldapoufilter"

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x diagnose.sh deploy_to_server.sh update.sh check_logs.sh test_filter.sh

# Upload to server (if you have deploy_to_server.sh configured)
./deploy_to_server.sh
```

**OR manually copy files to server using your usual method**

### Step 2: On Your Server
```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd /var/www/nextcloud/apps/ldapoufilter

# Make scripts executable
sudo chmod +x *.sh

# Run the update
sudo bash update.sh
```

### Step 3: Run Diagnostics
```bash
# Still on the server
sudo bash diagnose.sh
```

## 🧪 Test It

### Open another terminal and monitor logs:
```bash
sudo bash check_logs.sh -f
```

### In Nextcloud Web UI:
1. Log in as `hunter1` (cyberfirst OU)
2. Go to Files
3. Select a folder
4. Click "Share"
5. Type "bebo" in the search box

### Expected Result:
- ❌ **Should NOT see** any bebo users (they're in different OU)
- ✅ **Should ONLY see** users from cyberfirst OU

### Check Logs For:
```
=== OU EXTRACTION DEBUG ===
DN: CN=hunter1,OU=cyberfirst,OU=Mail,DC=Frist,DC=loc
Found 2 OU levels: ["OU=cyberfirst","OU=Mail"]
Selected specific OU (filtered out 'Mail'): OU=cyberfirst
=== FINAL SELECTED OU: OU=cyberfirst ===
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still see all users:

1. **Check what OU is being extracted:**
```bash
sudo bash diagnose.sh
```

Look for the `FINAL SELECTED OU` messages in the output.

2. **Verify event listener is firing:**
Look for `SearchResultEvent detected!` when searching.

3. **Share the logs with me:**
```bash
sudo bash check_logs.sh | tail -50
```

## 📞 Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Deploy update
sudo bash update.sh

# Run diagnostics
sudo bash diagnose.sh

# Monitor logs (real-time)
sudo bash check_logs.sh -f

# View recent errors
sudo bash check_logs.sh -e

# Test app
sudo bash test_filter.sh
```

## 💡 What Should Happen

### User in `cyberfirst` OU:
- Searches for "bebo" → **No results** ✅
- Searches for "hunter" → **Only cyberfirst users** ✅

### User in `bebo` OU:
- Searches for "hunter" → **No results** ✅
- Searches for "bebo" → **Only bebo users** ✅

- **CHANGES_SUMMARY.md** - All technical changes explained
- **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - General deployment guide

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Files updated on your Mac
- [ ] Scripts made executable (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] Files deployed to server
- [ ] `update.sh` executed on server
- [ ] `diagnose.sh` run to check OU extraction
- [ ] Logs monitored during test search
- [ ] Filtering verified (users from different OUs are hidden)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. Logs show specific OUs (cyberfirst, first, etc.) not just "Mail"
2. When searching, users from other OUs are NOT shown
3. Log shows: `Filtered search results: X -> Y users` with Y < X
