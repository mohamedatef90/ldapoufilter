## 🎯 What To Expect

After installation:

1. **User logs in** → Nextcloud queries their OU from database
2. **User searches for others** → Plugin filters results
3. **User sees only same-OU users** → Sharing works as intended

**Example**:
- User in `cyberfirst` OU types "john" in share dialog
- Gets results: Only users named "john" from `cyberfirst` OU
- Users named "john" from other OUs are hidden

## 🛠️ System Requirements

- ✅ Nextcloud 31.0 or later
- ✅ PHP 8.0 or later
- ✅ LDAP/Active Directory configured
- ✅ PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB
