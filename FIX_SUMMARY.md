# LDAP OU Service Fix Summary

## Problem
The LDAP OU Filter app was failing with "Failed to bind to LDAP" errors because it was trying to create its own LDAP connection using incorrect configuration keys and credentials.

## Root Cause
- App was using wrong configuration keys (`s01ldap_host` instead of `ldapHost`)
- App was trying to bind with credentials that didn't match Nextcloud's LDAP config
- App was creating unnecessary LDAP connections instead of using Nextcloud's existing infrastructure

## Solution
**Replaced custom LDAP connection with Nextcloud's LDAP user manager integration:**

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated LdapOuService.php:**
   - ✅ Removed custom LDAP connection logic
   - ✅ Added `IServerContainer` dependency injection
   - ✅ Implemented `getLdapDnViaNextcloud()` method
   - ✅ Uses Nextcloud's `User_Proxy` backend to get LDAP user objects
   - ✅ Extracts DN directly from LDAP user objects
   - ✅ Removed destructor (no more LDAP connections to close)

2. **Updated Application.php:**
   - ✅ Added `IServerContainer` to LdapOuService constructor
   - ✅ Updated service registration with new dependency

3. **Added Test Script:**
   - ✅ Created `test_ldap_fix.php` for testing the fix
   - ✅ Updated README.md with fix documentation

## Benefits
- ✅ **No more LDAP binding errors**
- ✅ **Uses existing Nextcloud LDAP configuration**
- ✅ **Better performance** (no new connections)
- ✅ **More reliable** (leverages Nextcloud's tested LDAP integration)
- ✅ **Simpler code** (less complexity)

## Testing
```bash
# Test the fix
php test_ldap_fix.php

# Check logs
tail -f /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log | grep ldapoufilter
```

## Files Modified
- `lib/Service/LdapOuService.php` - Complete rewrite of LDAP integration
- `lib/AppInfo/Application.php` - Updated dependency injection
- `test_ldap_fix.php` - New test script
- `README.md` - Added fix documentation

The app should now work correctly without LDAP authentication errors!
