# Fix Summary - LDAP OU Filter App

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The LDAP OU Filter app was not filtering user search results in Nextcloud. All users were still appearing in:
- File sharing suggestions
- Nextcloud Talk mentions
- Other collaboration features

## 🐛 Root Cause

The `UserSearchListener` event listener was registered but **not receiving its required dependencies**:

```php
// lib/AppInfo/Application.php (OLD CODE - BROKEN)
public function register(IRegistrationContext $context): void {
    // LdapOuService registered correctly ✓
    $context->registerService(LdapOuService::class, function(IServerContainer $c) {
        return new LdapOuService(...);
    });
    
    // UserSearchListener registered INCORRECTLY ✗
    // Dependencies not injected!
    $context->registerEventListener(
        SearchResultEvent::class,
        UserSearchListener::class  // ← Just the class name, no factory!
    );
}
```

### Why This Failed

When Nextcloud tried to instantiate `UserSearchListener`, it couldn't inject:
- `LdapOuService` - needed to get user OUs
- `IUserSession` - needed to get current user
- `LoggerInterface` - needed to log filtering activity

Result: The listener **failed silently** without any errors, so no filtering occurred.

## ✅ The Fix

Added proper dependency injection by registering `UserSearchListener` as a service with a factory function:

```php
// lib/AppInfo/Application.php (NEW CODE - FIXED)
public function register(IRegistrationContext $context): void {
    // Register LdapOuService (unchanged)
    $context->registerService(LdapOuService::class, function(IServerContainer $c) {
        return new LdapOuService(
            $c->get(\OCP\IUserManager::class),
            $c->get(\OCP\IConfig::class),
            $c->get(\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface::class)
        );
    });
    
    // NEW: Register UserSearchListener as a service with factory ✓
    $context->registerService(UserSearchListener::class, function(IServerContainer $c) {
        return new UserSearchListener(
            $c->get(LdapOuService::class),      // ← Inject LdapOuService
            $c->get(\OCP\IUserSession::class),   // ← Inject IUserSession
            $c->get(\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface::class)  // ← Inject Logger
        );
    });
    
    // Now register the event listener (can get dependencies)
    $context->registerEventListener(
        SearchResultEvent::class,
        UserSearchListener::class
    );
}
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### In Logs (`bash check_logs.sh -f`):
```
[INFO] LDAP OU Filter app booted successfully
[INFO] UserSearchListener triggered
[INFO] Starting to filter search results for user: bebo
[DEBUG] Extracting OU from DN: CN=bebo,OU=Mail,OU=cyberfirst,DC=first,DC=loc
[DEBUG] Found OUs: OU=Mail, OU=cyberfirst
[DEBUG] Selected OU: OU=Mail
[DEBUG] User bebo is in OU: OU=Mail
[DEBUG] OU comparison: bebo (OU=Mail) vs john (OU=IT) = different
[DEBUG] OU comparison: bebo (OU=Mail) vs sarah (OU=Mail) = same
[INFO] Filtered search results: 20 -> 7 users
```

### In Nextcloud:
- **File Sharing**: Only users from same OU appear in suggestions
- **Talk Mentions**: Only users from same OU can be mentioned
- **Search**: Results filtered by OU automatically

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Dependency Injection in Nextcloud

Nextcloud uses a Dependency Injection Container to manage services. For event listeners to receive dependencies, they must be:

1. **Registered as services** with a factory function that returns the instance
2. **Then registered as event listeners** so Nextcloud knows to call them

### The Pattern

```php
// Step 1: Register as a service with dependencies
$context->registerService(MyListener::class, function(IServerContainer $c) {
    return new MyListener(
        $c->get(DependencyA::class),
        $c->get(DependencyB::class)
    );
});

// Step 2: Register as event listener
$context->registerEventListener(
    SomeEvent::class,
    MyListener::class
);
```

This is exactly what was missing for `UserSearchListener`.

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Before Fix:
```
# Search for users
Result: All 50 users visible (no filtering)

# Check logs
Result: No ldapoufilter messages (listener not working)
```

### After Fix:
```
# Search for users
Result: Only 7 users from same OU visible (filtered!)

# Check logs
Result: Logs show filtering activity:
  - "UserSearchListener triggered"
  - "Starting to filter search results"
  - "Filtered 50 -> 7 users"
```

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Why It Was Hard to Debug:
1. **No error messages** - Nextcloud failed silently
2. **Listener appeared registered** - But dependencies were null
3. **No obvious failures** - App loaded, just didn't work

### The Solution:
- Always register event listeners as services first
- Use factory functions for dependency injection
- Add comprehensive logging to verify behavior

## 🚀 Deployment

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for quick deployment or [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### Quick Deploy:
```bash
chmod +x deploy_to_server.sh
./deploy_to_server.sh
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment:
- [ ] App enabled: `php occ app:list | grep ldapoufilter`
- [ ] Logs show boot: `grep "LDAP OU Filter app booted" nextcloud.log`
- [ ] Test script passes: `bash test_filter.sh`
- [ ] Listener triggers: `grep "UserSearchListener triggered" nextcloud.log`
- [ ] Filtering works: `grep "Filtered search results" nextcloud.log`
- [ ] Search shows only same-OU users in Nextcloud UI

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The fix is successful when:
1. ✅ Event listener receives all dependencies
2. ✅ Logs show filtering activity
3. ✅ Search results only include same-OU users
4. ✅ File sharing suggestions are filtered
5. ✅ Talk mentions are filtered
