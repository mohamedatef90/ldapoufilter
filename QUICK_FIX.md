# Quick Fix for LDAP OU Filter

## The Problem
The app was trying to use a method that doesn't exist:
```
Call to undefined method OCA\User_LDAP\User_Proxy::getLDAPUserByLoginName()
```

This caused:
- ❌ 500 errors in Talk when searching
- ❌ No users showing in search results
- ❌ OU filtering not working

## The Fix
I've replaced the non-existent method with a working approach:

1. **Direct LDAP connection** - Uses Nextcloud's LDAP configuration
2. **Proper configuration lookup** - Finds the active LDAP server (s01, s02, etc.)
3. **Multiple search strategies** - Tries different LDAP attributes
4. **Proper connection cleanup** - Closes LDAP connections after use

## Deploy to Server

The fixed file is in this directory. To deploy:

```bash
# On your development machine
# Option 1: Use the deployment script (if SSH is working)
./deploy_fix.sh

# Option 2: Manual deployment
# Copy the file to your server
scp lib/Service/LdapOuService.php root@your-server:/var/www/nextcloud/apps/ldapoufilter/lib/Service/

# On your server
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ cache:clear
systemctl reload apache2
```

## Test
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f /var/www/nextcloud/data/nextcloud.log | grep ldapoufilter

# Try searching in Nextcloud
# - Share a file and type a username
# - Search in Talk
```

The errors should now be gone and users should filter correctly by OU!
